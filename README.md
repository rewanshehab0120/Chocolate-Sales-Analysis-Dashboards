# Chocolate Sales Intelligence Dashboard 🍫📈

## 📌 Project Overview
This project transforms raw, fragmented chocolate sales data into a strategic decision-making tool. By leveraging **Excel** and **Power Query**, I cleaned and analyzed data to uncover hidden patterns and provided a UX-optimized dashboard for executive use.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
* **Microsoft Excel:** Data cleaning, Power Query, and Feature Engineering.
* **Data Visualization:** Pivot Tables, Slicers, and Interactive Charts.
* **Business Intelligence:** Trend analysis and strategic growth recommendations.

## 🔍 Key Insights & Impact
* **Efficiency Gap:** Identified that high sales volume doesn't always equal high revenue.
* **Sales Trends:** Detected a post-January decline, recommending seasonal marketing adjustments.
* **Geographic Insights:** Highlighted performance disparities between regions (Sharm El-Sheikh vs. Giza).
* **Creative Solutions:** Proposed the "Cashier Change" sampling strategy for low-performing areas.

## 🎨 Dashboard Design (UX)
The final dashboard was redesigned with **User Experience** in mind:
* **Light Mode:** For better accessibility and reduced eye strain.
* **Structured Backend:** Organized Pivot Tables for seamless future updates.
* **Direct Answers:** Focused on answering critical business questions at a glance.
